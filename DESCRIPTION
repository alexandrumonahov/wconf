Description: wconf is a package that allows users to create weighted confusion
    matrices and accuracy metrics that help with the model selection process
    for classification problems, where distance from the correct category is
    important. The package includes several weighting schemes which can be
    parametrized, as well as custom configuration options. Furthermore, users
    can decide whether they wish to positively or negatively affect the
    accuracy score as a result of applying weights to the confusion matrix.
    “wconf” integrates well with the “caret” package, but it can also work
    standalone when provided data in matrix form.
